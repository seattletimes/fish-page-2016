    "text": "The northernmost tip of Washington is the dividing point as salmon migrate south along the coast or head into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Many anglers make their summertime trek to catch large-sized chinook “king” salmon here. Fishing opens at Neah Bay from July 1-Aug. 21 or until a catch quota of 6,200 chinook is achieved. La Push is open from July 1-Aug. 21 or until a catch quota of 2,000 chinook is achieved. A robust population of lingcod, kelp greenling and black rockfish are here, too.",

Spring and summer is an excellent time to fish here. Anglers also like to fish for cutthroat trout. There is an artificial lure with barbless single-point hook rule, and it is catch and release for trout. No daily or size limit applies to largemouth bass, yellow perch, pikeminnow and bullhead.",

About 7,000 or so years ago, a large landslide dammed the lake and cutoff anadromous fish migration, including the beardslee trout, which are found nowhere else in the world. Catch-and-release fishing is open through Oct. 31. Artificial lures with a barbless single-point hook along with a two-ounce weight restriction is required. There are five fish species, including the native Beardslee, cutthroat trout (crescenti) and kokanee salmon. Two other non-recreational fish species are the pygmy whitefish and prickly sculpin.",

The Quillayute River system received a plant of 32,910 steelhead smolt in 2014, which are expected to return this summer. The Lower Quinault, Queets and Salmon rivers are also popular places to fish. Certain sections of the Hoh River are either open or closed for fishing, so be sure to check the regulation pamphlet before going.",

    "text": "“There are over 650 mountain lakes that can be accessed via a short day hike or multiple overnight stays,” biologist Sam Brenkman said. “These lakes have had systematic and casual stocking of non-native trout from 1934 to 1975, and were stocked via horseback, planes, helicopters and backpack. Within the lakes, we have Eastern brook trout and several varieties of cutthroat and rainbow trout.” The Seven Lakes Basin is home to eastern brook and rainbow trout. They include Soleduck, Morganroth, Long, No Name, Lunch, Clear, Lake 8 and Round, which are accessed via an 8-mile trail starting at the end of Sol Duc Hot Springs Road. On the east side of the park in Skokomish Valley, try Flapjack Lake, which has Eastern brook and rainbow trout. Off Hurricane Ridge and Obstruction Point Road are a series of lakes that include Moose, Grand and Gladys, which are primarily for Eastern brook trout. All are open now through Oct. 31.",

    "text": "A relatively flat beach-line and excellent access to nearby Kalaloch Lodge makes this a prime location to easily fish for a red tail surf perch. This under-fished species and largest in the surf perch family can be caught year-round, with summer offering the best action. Surf perch average 1 to 3 pounds. Key to success is looking for depressions, drop offs and deeper cuts in the beaches where the perch tend to school up. Use a long, stout fishing rod of 10 to 14 feet and a heavy spinning reel with 10- to 20-pound test fishing line. A slip sinker, three-quarters to 1 ounce, or a pyramid sinker of 3 to 5 ounces with a three-way swivel tied to a leader 20 to 30 inches long will get your bait where the fish are. Baits of choice are sand or ghost shrimp, sand crabs, mussels, clam necks, squid and pile worms. Soft plastic jigs laced with anise scent as well as Buzz Bomb-type jigs will attract fish.",
